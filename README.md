## Hey

My name is Robin Candau, I'm 26.  
  
Iâ€™m a french Linux system engineer passionate by skate, music, (craft) beers and, obviously, Linux!  
I'm an [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) Trusted User/Package Maintainer, a [Crystal Linux](https://getcryst.al/) Core Team member and a general Open Source contributor.  
  
I also have a [personal blog](https://rc-linux.com) on which I write articles *from time to time* (meaning once every 6 months :smile:)!  
   
You can reach me at `robincandau@protonmail.com`, `@Antiz96` on Twitter or `Antiz#4953` on Discord.  
I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-candau-3083a2173/?locale=en_US).
