## Hey

My name is Robin Candau, I'm 26.  
  
Iâ€™m a french Linux system engineer passionate by skate, music, (craft) beers and, obviously, Linux.  
I contribute to [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) in several ways, I also contribute to the [packaging of Ubuntu Unity port to Arch Linux](https://gitlab.com/unity-for-arch) and I'm a package and infrastructure maintainer at [Crystal Linux](https://getcryst.al/).  
  
I also have a personal blog on which I write articles *from time to time* (meaning once every 6 months :smile:): [rc-linux.com](https://rc-linux.com).  
   
You can reach me at `robincandau[at]protonmail[dot]com`, `@Antiz96` on Twitter or `Antiz#4953` on Discord.  
I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-candau-3083a2173/?locale=en_US).
