# Hey! :wave:

I'm Robin Candau (also known as Antiz), a french Linux system & DevOps engineer passionate about skateboarding, music, cycling and, obviously, Linux!

I'm an open source enthusiast, maintaining packages for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=&maintainer=Antiz) as well as some packages for [Alpine Linux](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=&branch=edge&repo=&arch=&maintainer=Robin+Candau).

You can find general information about me and my work on [my website](https://antiz.fr), on which I also publish some [blog posts](https://antiz.fr/blog/) when I feel like it.
