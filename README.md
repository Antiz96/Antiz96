### Hey

My name is Robin Candau, I'm 26.  
  
Iâ€™m a french Linux system engineer passionate by skate, music, (craft) beers and, obviously, Linux.  
I contribute to [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) in several ways and I'm a packager at [Crystal-Linux](https://getcryst.al/).  
  
You can reach me at robincandau[at]protonmail[dot]com or `Antiz#4953` on Discord.  
For those who cares about LinkedIn, I'm [there](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-candau-3083a2173/?locale=en_US) as well :smile:.
