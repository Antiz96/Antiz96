# Hey! :wave:

My name is Robin Candau (also known as Antiz).  
I'm a French Linux systems & DevOps engineer passionate about music, cycling, skateboarding and the Linux ecosystem!

I'm interested in Linux system development, packaging, infrastructure, reproducible builds and supply chain security.

I'm primarily involved in [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), fulfilling [multiple roles within the Arch Linux Staff](https://archlinux.org/people/package-maintainers/#Antiz), but I also contribute to [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) and [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/).

You can find general information about me and my work on [my website](https://antiz.fr), where I also publish [blog posts](https://antiz.fr/blog/) from time to time.
