# Hey! :wave:

I'm Robin Candau, a french Linux system & DevOps engineer passionate about skateboarding, music, cycling and, obviously, Linux!

I'm a general open source enthusiast, maintaining packages for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=&maintainer=Antiz) as well as some packages for [Alpine Linux](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=&branch=edge&repo=&arch=&maintainer=Robin+Candau).

You can find general & contact info about me on [my website](https://antiz.fr) on which I also write some [blog posts](https://antiz.fr/blog/) when I feel like it.
