# Hey! :wave:

My name is Robin Candau (also known as Antiz).  
I'm a french Linux system & DevOps engineer passionate about skateboarding, music, cycling and, obviously, Linux!

I'm interested in Linux System Development, Packaging, Infrastructure, Reproducible Builds and Supply Chain Security.

I'm an open source enthusiast, maintaining packages for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=&maintainer=Antiz) as well as some packages for [Alpine Linux](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=&branch=edge&repo=&arch=&maintainer=Robin+Candau).

You can find general information about me and my work on [my website](https://antiz.fr), on which I also publish some [blog posts](https://antiz.fr/blog/) when I feel like it.

## Projects

As an open source enthusiast, I contribute to many open source projects and I’m always willing to help, share and learn in the process!
The main projects I actively contribute to are:

### Arch Linux

![arch_linux-logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fb1b514-2410-4fb4-b5e9-21797ddb77b0)

[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that focuses on simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality and versatility.

- Package Maintainer: As part of the [Arch Linux Package Maintainers](https://archlinux.org/people/package-maintainers/#Antiz), I contribute to the development of the distribution by maintaining [packages](https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=&maintainer=Antiz) in Arch's official repositories.

- DevOps: As part of the DevOps team, I contribute to the maintenance of the [Arch Linux infrastructure](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/infrastructure).

- WSL image maintainer: I maintain the [official Arch Linux WSL image](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/archlinux-wsl).

- Testing team member and coordinator: As a [testing team](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Testing_Team) member, I test & verify packages submitted to the Arch Linux testing repositories before they get promoted to the stable ones. I’m also in charge of on-boarding new testing team members.

- AUR Package maintainer and moderator: In addition of maintaining packages in the official repositories, I'm also maintaining [some packages](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&SeB=M&K=Antiz&outdated=&SB=p&SO=d&PP=50&submit=Go) in the AUR (a [community-driven repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository) maintained by Arch users) and I participate to its moderation.

- Various other contributions: I’m also contributing to numerous other parts of the Arch Linux project as whole, such as some of our tools (e.g. [pacman-contrib](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman-contrib), [devtools / pkgctl](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/devtools), [archlinux-contrib](https://github.com/archlinux/contrib)), [reproducible builds](https://reproducible.archlinux.org/), [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org), [submitting RFCs](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/rfcs), interacting with the community...

### Reproducible Builds

[Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) are a set of software development practices that create an independently-verifiable path from source to binary code.

- Contributor: I regularly submit upstream and downstream patches in regards to Reproducible Builds, [some of them](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/-/commits/master?author=Robin%20Candau) being covered in reproducible-builds.org’s [monthly news](https://reproducible-builds.org/news/).

### Alpine Linux

[Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org) is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox.

- Packaging: I maintain [some packages](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=&branch=edge&repo=&arch=&maintainer=Robin+Candau) in Alpine Linux repositories and I'm contributing at raising & fixing some packaging issues. I am also maintaining [some of Alpine's packaging tooling](https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=alpine&maintainer=Antiz&flagged=) in Arch Linux repositories.

### Arch-Update

![arch_update-logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0fdbeca-647c-4d92-bc30-4584a2b7ac09)

[Arch-Update](https://github.com/Antiz96/arch-update) is an update notifier & applier for Arch Linux that assists you with important pre / post update tasks.

- Developer / Maintainer: Arch-Update is one of the Open Source projects I develop and maintain over on [GitHub](https://github.com/Antiz96)
