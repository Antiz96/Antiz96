# Hey! :wave:

My name is Robin Candau (also known as Antiz).  
I'm a French Linux system & DevOps engineer passionate about skateboarding, music, cycling and, obviously, Linux!

I'm interested in Linux System Development, Packaging, Infrastructure, Reproducible Builds and Supply Chain Security.

I'm primarily involved in [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), fulfilling [multiple roles within the Arch Linux Staff](https://archlinux.org/people/package-maintainers/#Antiz), but I also contribute to [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) and [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/).

You can find general information about me and my work on [my website](https://antiz.fr), on which I also publish some [blog posts](https://antiz.fr/blog/) when I feel like it.
